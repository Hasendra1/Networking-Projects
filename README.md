# Packet Tracer Projects

## Overview
This repository contains three networking projects created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project focuses on specific networking concepts and configurations, designed to enhance understanding and practical skills in network design and management.

## Projects

### 1. Fragmentation
- Description: Demonstrates packet fragmentation in a network environment.
- Key Features:
  - Simulates scenarios where packet fragmentation occurs.
  - Analyzes the effects of fragmentation on network performance.
  - Includes tools and configurations to visualize packet behavior.
- Learning Objectives:
  - Understand packet fragmentation.
  - Explore the relationship between MTU, packet size, and network performance.

### 2. Inter-VLAN Routing
- Description: Implements inter-VLAN routing for seamless communication between VLANs.
- Key Features:
  - Configured multiple VLANs for traffic segmentation.
  - Set up a Layer 3 device (router or multilayer switch) for inter-VLAN communication.
  - Applied basic security measures to VLAN configurations.
- Learning Objectives:
  - Configure VLANs and trunks.
  - Enable routing between VLANs using a Layer 3 device.
  - Understand the importance of inter-VLAN routing in modern networks.

### 3. Enterprise Network
- Description: A comprehensive enterprise network setup incorporating advanced networking concepts.
- Key Features:
  - OSPF for dynamic routing.
  - VLANs and trunking for traffic segmentation and efficient communication.
  - DHCP for automated IP address allocation.
  - Configured multiple subnets for scalability.
- Learning Objectives:
  - Design and implement scalable enterprise networks.
  - Configure OSPF for efficient routing in large networks.
  - Use VLANs and trunking for segmentation.
  - Implement DHCP for dynamic IP allocation.
